## Description
I planned very early for my UI to be based on a solar system. I created an [experimental project](https://github.com/Red350/Solar_system_experiment) in the first few weeks of the module, which consisted of a solar system simulation that could be sped up, slowed down, and even reversed. I ended up starting completely from scratch with the actual assingnment, though I learned a lot from that which I applied to the current version.
